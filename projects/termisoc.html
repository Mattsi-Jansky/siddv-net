				Established in 1992 <a href="http://termisoc.org/" target="_blank">TermiSoc</a> is the Plymouth University computing society. I was the chairman for the society for two and a half years between 2011 and 2013. During these years we organized and ran numerous events scaling from small weekend projects to 50+ person LAN parties. Alongside these non-regular events we also ran fortnightly tutorials where we'd organize someone to come in and talk/teach about their area of expertise - I myself hosting some tutorials on web development. Being a designer, I also produced all of the TermiSoc promotional material, with the color scheme and logo based on that produced by the previous chairmen of the society.

				Above are a few example of the posters I produced for the society. The first is one I made for promoting TermiSoc to freshers. The second, using a couple of images from <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation" target="_blank">Zero Punctuation</a>, is one I designed to promote one of our LAN events. Finally the third is one I designed and illustrated from scratch as somewhat of a pet project, aiming to create a propaganda-style poster.
