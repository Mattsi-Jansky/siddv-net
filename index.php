			<h2>Who I am</h2>
			<p>
				I'm Sidd; a designer, developer and general all-round maker. I like creating both virtual and physical experiences, being versatile enough to tackle any part of a project, be it design, coding or hardware. Focusing on bringing all elements together to create a streamlined user experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently I'm based in London UK working as an Angular developer at <a href="http://ba.com" target="_blank">British Airways</a>, having graduated last year in BSc <a href="http://digitalartandtechnology.co.uk" target="_blank">Digital Art &amp; Technology</a> with a first-class honours from Plymouth University.

					<h3>Mobius</h3>

					<p>
						<a href="http://mobius.siddv.net/" target="_blank">Mobius</a> was my university final project. It is a framework for creating wireless Arduino projects with web-based control. Mobius generates both, the web-based control and the Ardunio code, allowing you to create huge porions of projects without writing a single line of code.

					<h3>Quartz</h3>

					<p>
						<a href="http://quartz.jamiepat.es" target="_blank">Quartz</a> was an interactive installation. As an individual walks past a physical phone, the phone will ring enticing the user to answer it. Once answered the user will be connected to a random phone number from a database of people who have opted into the project, creating a conversation between two strangers.

					<h3>Laptop Screen Monitor</h3>

					<p>
						This was a project I undertook when my previous laptop died. Aiming to reuse as many of the components as possible, I modified the laptop's screen to function as an external monitor. This project was quite a popular one, generating around 1.2 million views acorss a number of media websites.

					<h3>KOTH</h3>

					<p>
						<a href="http://koth.soddv.net/" target="_blank">KOTH</a> is a game based on '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Hill_(game)" target="_blank">king of the hill</a>' that takes place both physically &amp; digitally. Players must enter randomly generated codes on their smartphone, the active code is displayed in a set location. After a user has entered the code, they become king. This initiates a cooldown on the code screen until the next code generates.
