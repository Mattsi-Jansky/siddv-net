                <p>
                    Hello. My name is Siddharth Vadgama, but I generally go by Sidd. I design things, I code things and I also make physical things with electronics and hardware and whatnot. I get a little bit excited when I do projects that combine all three.
                </p>

                    I like to think of myself as a pretty competent creator. I love problem-solving, and building systems that really offer a fun and engaging experience to the user. I use OS X, Windows and Linux, with my preference for any given project being determined by what will help me get the task at hand done in the best, most efficient way possible (Hint: It's usually OS X).
                </p>
