          Pictured above the poster I designed for an event hosted by Plymouth-based company, SoLarge. The event was themed around the pseudo-reality televison show The Only Way Is Essex. I was tasked to design a logo, theme and acompanying media for the event. Deadling with SoLarge, I produced the poster above, facebook banner (pictured below) and a number of assets for SoLarge to use on other media.
